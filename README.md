# Traffic Simulation using Differential Equations

This is a project for MATH341 at UMD designed to visualize the "follow-the-leader" and "optimal velocity" differential models of traffic on a loop of road. Both of these are systems of second order non-linear differential equations with solutions estimated programmatically.
